## Approach:
The approach used in this solution is the hash table approach.

In this approach, we traverse the input list of numbers only once, and for each number, we calculate its complement with respect to the target. We then check if the complement is already in the hash table. If it is, then we have found the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, and we can return them immediately. If the complement is not in the hash table, then we add the current number and its index to the hash table so that we can find its complement later.

By using a hash table, we can perform lookups and insertions in constant time on average, which gives us a time complexity of O(n) for the entire algorithm. This is faster than the brute-force approach, which has a time complexity of O(n^2).

The hash table approach also has a space complexity of O(n), which is the same as the brute-force approach. This is because in the worst case, we need to store all the numbers and their indices in the hash table. However, the hash table approach is more efficient in practice because it avoids the nested loop of the brute-force approach, which can be slow for large input sizes.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
	def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
		# Initialize an empty dictionary to serve as a hash table
		hash_table = {}
		# Loop through the list of numbers and their indices using the enumerate() function
		for i, num in enumerate(nums):
			# Calculate the complement of the current number with respect to the target
			complement = target - num
			# Check if the complement is already in the hash table
			if complement in hash_table:
				# If it is, then return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target
				return [hash_table[complement], i]
			# If the complement is not in the hash table, then add the current number and its index to the hash table
			hash_table[num] = i
